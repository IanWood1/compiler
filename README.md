# Compiler

This is a compiler project that implements a custom programming language. The language is heavily influenced by C++ with
some differences and without many C++ features.

This project is a **work in progress**. Help is welcome and appreciated as it would allow the scope of the project to
grow.

### Some of the features include:

- Basic types: int64, int64&, int64[N], and int64[N]&
- Pass by value and pass by reference semantics
- Structs with member access and associated functions
- Arrays with compile-time size
- User defined functions and types
